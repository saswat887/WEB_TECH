Function:-
It is a space where we write business logic or application logic.
Function are having 2 parts:-
1.Function Declaration
2.Function Call

Basically it is a bunch of code which can be reused multiple times.
If we want to execute a function then we have to call it.
In javascript function are of two types:-
1.Inbuilt function-> These are the functions defined previously to perform some specific activity. Eg:-push(),pop(),shift(),unshift()
2.Customize Function->It is a function which is defined by developer to fulfil his requirement

It is declared by the help of function keyword
Syntax:-
function function_name()
{

}

function xyz()
{
    console.log("Hi")
}
xyz()

A function can be called multiple no of times

Eg

function abcd(k)
{
    console.log(k)
}
abcd(10) //10
abcd("hello") //hello
abcd() //undefined

In javascript it is not mandatory to pass exact number of  actual argument to a function

ARRAY:-
It is used to store multiple elements in a single memory location.
In javascript arrays have flexible memory.

Syntax:-
var  variable_name=[e1,e2,...............,en]

It is a collection both homogenous and heterogenous elements.
It is ordered in nature 
Arrays have indexed

Methods of Array:-
1.toString()
    it is use to convert all the elements of to String
    Syntax:-
    vn.toString()
    eg:-
    var hh=[10,20,30]
    hh.toString()
    "10","20","30"

2.join()
 Syntax:-
    vn.join()
    hh.join('*')
    '10*20*30'
    it is use to convert all the elements of our array to string by the entered glue character

3.push()
    Syntax
    vn.push(element)
    It is used to add elements to array and it will add that elements at the end of array
    hh.push(90)
    10,20,30,90

4.unshift()
Syntax
vn.unshift(element)
It is used to add value to add array starting of array

5.pop()
Syntax
vn.pop()
It is used to remove values from our array and it always removes the last elements
eg:-
hh.pop()
40

6.shift()
Syntax:-
It is used to remove first element of array
